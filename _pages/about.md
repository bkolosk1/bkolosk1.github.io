I'm a Ph.D student at the Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School. My research is focused on the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Learning on Graphs. 
I am keen on exploring how machine learning models perform in low-resource setting for less-represented languages, especially interested in transfer-learning within cross-lingual applications. 
I find the process of transferring acquired knowledge fascinating, and I equally enjoy the act of teaching.

I am Macedonian, born in Bitola, Macedonia on 8th January 1999. I finished my elementray (OU. Todor Angelevski) and secondary school (SOU. Josip Broz Tito, nautral-mathematics major) in my home town. In 2017 I moved to Ljubljana Slovenia to pursue my further studies. I got my undergraduate degree from the Faculty of Computer and Information Science of the University of Ljubljana. 

I love talking about science, beer, indie music bands and video games.
